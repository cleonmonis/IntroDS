This project analyzes and predicts Amazon stock volatility in response to major market events, company announcements, and economic indicators. Using historical data from 1997-2025, we identify patterns in volatility responses to different event types and build a gradient boosting model that achieves an RÂ² score of 0.839. The implementation includes comprehensive volatility metric calculations, an events database with importance ratings, event-stock data integration, and a prediction framework for forecasting volatility around future events. We hope our tool provides valuable insights for investment strategies, risk management, and understanding how major events impact Amazon's stock behavior.
